    <h2>Trying out CloudEHRServer</h2>
    <p>
      We have two staging servers that we use for testing and demos, that are
      publicly accessible. You can create a test account directly on those servers.
      Consider that those are small servers, with that we mean that are really sloooow,
      and might not have the latest version of the EHRServer installed, but we try
      to keep them up to date. Also the service might not be available 100% of the time.
      <ul>
        <li>Staging 1: <a href="https://cabolabs-ehrserver.rhcloud.com/" target="_blank">cabolabs-ehrserver.rhcloud.com</a> (old version)</li>
        <li>Staging 2: <a href="https://ehrserver-cabolabs2.rhcloud.com/login/auth" target="_blank">ehrserver-cabolabs2.rhcloud.com</a> (latest version)</li>
