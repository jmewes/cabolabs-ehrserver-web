    <h2>Why join as a Beta Partner?</h2>
    <p>
      We want to empower a small group of companies to become experts on the use and management
      of the EHRServer. Collaborating with them during the initial phases of evaluating,
      testing and prototyping using our services.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the best out of the EHRServer, some openEHR knowledge is needed and it can take
      some time to understand the basics. Also to fully understand the EHRServer management,
      some insights about the internal design are helpful. During the Beta Partners Program
      we will transfer all that knowledge to you, in a fraction of the time that it can take
      to learn from the specs.

    <h2>Investment</h2>
    <p>
      The Beta Partner fee will help us maintain and scale the infrastructure, and
      add new features to the product. This fee will be on the same price level of
      a small sized plan, but it will have no constraints at all in terms of the
      number of organizations, users and EHRs like plans will have. This allows
      you to use the service without worrying about limits and quotas, while we
      secure the next phases of the product. Consider this as a micro-investment
      in our product that is paid back in knowledge-transfer.
    </p>

    <p>On the roadmap we have some big topics:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Create tools for testing and monitoring</li>
     <li>Reporting</li>
     <li>Automatic Backups</li>
     <li>Export / Import data between EHRServers</li>
     <li>Extend querying capabilities</li>
     <li>Improve GUI and usability</li>
     <li>Create new documentation, guides and other learning resources</li>
     <li><a href="<?=$_base_dir?>/contact">Let us know what is important to you!</a></li>
